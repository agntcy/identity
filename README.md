**Explore comprehensive guides and best practices for implementing and managing identity for agents.**

## Getting Started

- üåê Explore our full [Documentation](https://spec.identity.agntcy.org) to understand our platform's capabilities
- üìö Dive into our [API Specs](https://spec.identity.agntcy.org/protodocs/agntcy/identity/core/v1alpha1/id.proto) for detailed API documentation
- üì¶ Install our sample agents and MCP servers [Samples](samples/README.md)
- üõ†Ô∏è Use the [Issuer CLI](identity/cmd/issuer/README.md) to manage issuers and credentials
- üèóÔ∏è Deploy the [Node Backend](identity/cmd/node/README.md) to handle identity management
- üîê Start issuing and verifying credentials with our [Quick Start](https://docs.agntcy.org/pages/identity-howto.html#quick-start)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

To run the `Node Backend` the `Issuer CLI`, and the `Samples` locally, you need to have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) 1.24 or later
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)
- Python 3.12 or later

### Step 1: Install the Issuer CLI

```bash
go install github.com/agntcy/identity/cmd/issuer@latest
```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agntcy/identity.git
```

### Step 3: Start the Node Backend with Docker

Run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
make start_node
```

### Step 4: Run the Samples with Docker

1. Run the Llama 3.2 model:

   ```bash
   ollama run llama3.2
   ```

2. Navigate to the `samples` directory and run the following command:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Step 5: Register as an Issuer

### Step 6: Onboard an MCP Server

### Step 7: Verify Credentials
